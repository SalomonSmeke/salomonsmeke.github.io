# Contributing to ssmeke.io

Thank you, netizen for taking the time to contribute to my project.

And thank you, [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), for providing me with a jump-off point for this.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## How Can I Contribute?

There isn't really a complex procedure, this is a tiny personal project. There really is only one ask:

*   Please submit a github issue.

By this I mean: avoid sending a pull request that is not linked to an issue.

## Style constraints:

I wish I was consistent enough to demand a certain style from a contributor. Please simply go by the rule:

*   When in Rome, do as the Romans.

And keep eslint happy.

Cheers,
Salomon
