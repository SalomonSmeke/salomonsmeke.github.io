## ssmeke.io

Just a personal website where I mess around.

Currently under construction. Once this is done, my old website will be available at:

[ssmeke.io/old-site](http://ssmeke.io/old-site)

TO-DOs:

* Figure out the standalone pages structure.
* Optimize for mobile (though i've kept this in the back of my head).

Guidelines:

* No images
* Modules
* VanillaJS, regular CSS.
