## ssmeke.io

Just a personal website where I mess around.

Currently under construction. Once this is done, my old website will be available at:

[ssmeke.io](http://ssmeke.io)

TO-DOs:

* Create deploy script.
* Figure out the standalone pages structure.
* Write the bars functionality.
* Draw the final nav-functionality.
* Optimize for mobile (though i've kept this in the back of my head).
* Zork.
* Bars-UI.

Guidelines:

* Filesizes < 14KB
* No images
* Modules
* VanillaJS, regular CSS.
